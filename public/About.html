    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Welcome to my travel portfolio, Love Travelling. I’m YoungBloodTraveller,
        a group traveller writing about my visits to countries near and far.
        I research destinations myself and that’s part of the fun – visiting the local library
        and selecting some travel guides, looking things up online and,
        of course, all the amazing tips I discover from fellow travellers.<br />
        My passion is travel,
        I just love visiting new places,
        immersing myself into local cultures of life around the world
        and discovering the unexpected! Stepping off a plane,
        I’m always in a hurry to get my passport stamped,
        reclaim my luggage and walk out of the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure.
